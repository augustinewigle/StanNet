Description: StanNet is a variant of BUGSnet (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs Sampling to conduct NETwork meta-analysis) package which uses Stan in place of JAGS to conduct Markov Chain Monte Carlo through user-specified inputs. The package supports additional data exploration, simulation, and diagnostics not originally present in BUGSnet. Users of this package must first download Stan on their computer prior to use.
